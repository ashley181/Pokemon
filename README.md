# Pokemon

Pokémon is a role-playing game series where you, as a trainer, catch pokemon to battle with other pokemon trainers in a quest to be the best. The strength of a pokemon is determined by its stats, with each pokemon having its own Special Attack, Attack, Special Defense, Defense, Speed, and Hit Points values. Included in the game is a “rock-paper-scissors” advantage system based on a Pokemon’s type. There are 18 different types a Pokemon can have. For example, Fire is strong against Grass, Grass is strong against Water, Water is strong against Fire. Or, Normal type is resistant to Ghost, but vulnerable to Fighting (Tapsell). We will observe a data set of 721 unique Pokémon sourced from kaggle. 

We want to predict the primary type of a pokemon using the following elements from our data set: hp, speed, defense, special defense, attack, and special attack. We chose to use individual values instead of total because the resulting trends in the data will allow us to more accurately predict the primary type of a pokemon. Since we want to predict a categorical variable using quantitative data, we will use a classification model to conduct our data analysis. In short, we will test and train our data, and examine folds of our data as we have in Chapter 7. We will examine our results by observing the accuracies of our testing set.
